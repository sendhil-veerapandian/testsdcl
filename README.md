# SDLC Automation Platform

## _Automate your entire software development lifecycle from idea to release_

## Overview
SDLC Automation Platform is an end-to-end solution designed to automate your entire software development lifecycle. This project leverages a modular, graph-based architecture to transform user requirements into a fully deployed solution. It handles everything from collecting user requirements and generating user stories to creating design documents, code generation, security and test reviews, and deployment. In addition, Markdown artifacts for each phase are automatically generated and made available for download.

SDLC Automation Platform uses a state-driven graph (powered by [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph)) with conditional routing to manage the process. The project also integrates with Redis (optionally hosted externally) for caching and state persistence, and provides a visual workflow diagram of the entire process.

## Features
- **End-to-End SDLC Automation:** Automates every stage of the software development lifecycle‚Äîfrom project initialization to deployment.
- **Graph-Based Orchestration:** Uses a state-driven graph with conditional routing to manage SDLC tasks.
- **Artifact Generation:** Automatically generates Markdown documentation for:
  - Project Requirements
  - User Stories
  - Design Documents (Functional & Technical)
  - Generated Code
  - Security Recommendations
  - Test Cases
  - QA Testing Comments
  - Deployment Feedback
- **Interactive Review & Feedback:** Dynamic review cycles at multiple stages with options to approve or provide feedback with Humman-in-the-Loop.

## üöÄ Complete Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ 
- Docker Desktop
- At least one LLM API key (Gemini, Groq, or OpenAI)

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### 1. Clone and Setup Environment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd SDLC  # or whatever folder name you used

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
# LLM API Keys (you need at least one)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Redis Configuration (for local Docker)
# No additional config needed for local Docker Redis
```

**Get API Keys:**
- **Gemini (Free)**: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key
- **Groq (Free)**: https://console.groq.com/keys  
- **OpenAI (Paid)**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

#### 3. Start Redis (State Management)

**What is Redis?** Redis is a temporary storage system that remembers your project progress as you move through different SDLC stages. Think of it as the application's memory.

**Why do we need it?** When you create projects, generate user stories, and progress through development stages, Redis stores this information so you can continue where you left off.

```bash
# Start Docker Desktop first, then:
docker pull redis
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name sdlc-redis redis
```

**Redis Management Commands:**
```bash
# Check if Redis is running
docker ps

# Start Redis (after computer restart)
docker start sdlc-redis

# Stop Redis (when done working)
docker stop sdlc-redis

# Auto-start Redis on computer boot (optional)
docker update --restart unless-stopped sdlc-redis
```

**Important Notes:**
- Redis runs in the **background** - you don't need a separate terminal
- After computer restart, run: `docker start sdlc-redis`
- If you see `sdlc-redis` in `docker ps`, it's running ‚úÖ

### üñ•Ô∏è Running the Application

#### Option 1: FastAPI Backend (API Access)
```bash
# Production mode
python app_api.py

# Development mode (with auto-reload)
uvicorn src.sdlc.api.fastapi_app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```
- **Server**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Interactive API**: http://localhost:8000/redoc

#### Option 2: Next.js Frontend (Modern Web UI)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
- **Web UI**: http://localhost:3000 (opens automatically)
- **Note**: Modern React-based frontend with enterprise-grade UI

### üîß Alternative Redis Setup (Cloud)
If you prefer cloud Redis instead of Docker:

1. **Sign up for Upstash Redis** (free tier available)
2. **Update** `src/sdlc/cache/redis_cache.py`:
   ```python
   # Comment out Docker Redis
   # redis_client = redis.Redis(...)
   
   # Uncomment Upstash Redis
   REDIS_URL = os.getenv("REDIS_URL")
   REDIS_TOKEN = os.getenv("REDIS_TOKEN")
   redis_client = Redis(url=REDIS_URL, token=REDIS_TOKEN)
   ```
3. **Add to .env**:
   ```env
   REDIS_URL=your_upstash_redis_url
   REDIS_TOKEN=your_upstash_redis_token
   ```

```

### 3. Update Workflow Progress

Update the SDLC workflow progress (e.g., moving to the review phase) by providing the next node, status, and feedback. This endpoint updates the workflow state and returns the updated state along with the next node to proceed to. This contains the humman in the loop feedback.

**Request:**
```http
POST /api/v1/sdlc/progress_flow
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "project_name": "Ecommerce Platform",
    "task_id": "sdlc-session-f0b4d555",
    "next_node": "review_user_stories", // next node to proceed to, each iteration will return the next node to proceed to
    "status": "approved", // approved or feedback
    "feedback": "None" // if status is feedback then provide the input
}
```
**Response:**

}
```

### How to Use
- **Start the Process:**  
  Send the "start" request to initialize the SDLC process, which returns a task ID and state.
  
- **Generate User Stories:**  
  Use the task ID from the start process, along with the project requirements, to generate user stories.
  
- **Update Workflow Progress:**  
  With the task ID, update the workflow (for example, by approving or giving feedback on user stories). With each iteration pass the next node to proceed to and the status of the previous node. Status can be approved or feedback. Based on the status the next node will be determined. Once the workflow is completed it will return the end node, which indicates the completion of the SDLC process.

- **Added Postman collection for reference.**

## üéØ Usage Guide

### Using the FastAPI (For Developers)

1. **Start SDLC Process**:
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/sdlc/start
   {
     "project_name": "My Project"
   }
   ```

2. **Generate User Stories**:
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/sdlc/user_stories
   {
     "project_name": "My Project",
     "requirements": ["Requirement 1", "Requirement 2"],
     "task_id": "returned_task_id"
   }
   ```

3. **Progress Workflow**:
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/sdlc/progress_flow
   {
     "project_name": "My Project",
     "task_id": "task_id",
     "next_node": "review_user_stories",
     "status": "approved",
     "feedback": "None"
   }
   ```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Import Errors**
```bash
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.sdlc'
```
**Solution**: Make sure you're in the project root directory and virtual environment is activated.

**2. Redis Connection Error**
```bash
redis.exceptions.ConnectionError
```
**Solution**: 
- Start Docker Desktop
- Run: `docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name sdlc-redis redis`

**3. Schema Validation Errors**
```bash
tool call validation failed: parameters for tool UserStoryList did not match schema
```
**Solution**: This usually happens when the AI model generates data that doesn't match our expected format. The error should be automatically resolved with the latest schema updates.

**4. Logs Appearing in Frontend Terminal**
```bash
Backend logs showing in Next.js terminal
```
**Explanation**: This is normal behavior. The Next.js app communicates with the FastAPI backend, so backend logs appear in the backend terminal while frontend logs appear in the frontend terminal.

**5. API Key Errors**
```bash
Missing required API keys
```
**Solution**: 
- Create `.env` file with valid API keys
- Ensure at least one LLM provider key is set

**4. Package Version Conflicts**
```bash
ImportError: cannot import name 'LangSmithParams'
```
**Solution**: 
```bash
pip install langchain-google-genai==2.1.8 --force-reinstall
```

**5. Config File Not Found**
```bash
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'split'
```
**Solution**: Config file path issue - already fixed in latest version.

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start with auto-reload (Development)
